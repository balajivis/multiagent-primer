# Build Sprint — `tiny-crm-cli`

You are a 3-agent team building **tiny-crm-cli**, a small JSON-backed lead management CLI. The starter codebase is in `project/` — currently a `package.json` and a stub `src/cli.ts`.

## What "done" looks like

A working `tiny-crm-cli` that supports:

```
tiny-crm add-lead "Alice Smith" alice@example.com
tiny-crm list [--status new|qualified|customer]
tiny-crm convert <lead-id>
tiny-crm report
tiny-crm tag <lead-id> <tag>
```

Storage: `data/leads.json` (created on first write). One JSON record per lead. No external DB.

Tests pass under `npm test`. README quickstart at `project/README.md`.

## How the work decomposes

12 starter tasks are pre-loaded in `tasks.json`, tagged by capability. There are
six capability tags but **three agents** — each agent owns a cluster, so every
task has an owner:

| Agent | Owns tags | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **backend** | `backend`, `db`, `devops` | CLI dispatcher, commands, validation, storage + locks, package.json/tsconfig |
| **frontend** | `frontend`, `docs` | output formatting (table, colour, filter), help/usage, README quickstart |
| **tests** | `tests` | unit tests + smoke script |

Each agent claims only tasks matching the tags it owns (see
`.claude/agents/<role>.md`). The CLI does **not** enforce this — claiming
outside your tags is visible as weak output, exactly like Lab 2 Round 2.

## Time budget

60 minutes. Don't optimise for completeness — optimise for *real coordination*. A team that ships 8 well-coordinated tasks scores higher in `eval-self.sh` than a team that ships 12 with broken handoffs.

## Acceptance signals

- `node project/src/cli.ts add-lead "Test" t@e.com` runs without error
- `data/leads.json` contains one record after the above
- All 12 tasks have a non-`open` status
- Failed tasks have a `lessons` field
- Blackboard has performative entries (not just `INFORM`)

## What is NOT graded

- Code style (this is a 60-minute sprint, not a code review)
- Whether all 12 tasks shipped (8 with good handoffs > 12 with chaos)
- Whether you finished `report` or `tag` (those are stretch goals)
